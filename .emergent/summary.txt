The AI engineer successfully developed the MediFleet application from scratch, addressing multiple user requirements iteratively. Initial work focused on core features: a professional landing page, real-time task tracking with robot bidding, detailed robot management, and an advanced analytics dashboard. The development included creating necessary backend API endpoints and a React frontend with proper routing and modern UI/UX principles, utilizing Shadcn UI components. Subsequent iterations added a visually impressive bidding visualization modal, an interactive hospital floor map with animated robot movements and path connectivity, and simulation features for demo purposes. Further enhancements included ensuring robot initial positioning, fixing dropdown consistency, implementing advanced robot movement animations, and polishing the About page, adding MQTT/API documentation pages, and integrating a dark mode toggle. The current task involves refining the ENTRANCE waypoint into a detailed robot parking station with specific robot positioning and labels.

*   **Simulation/Demo Features:** Simulate Movement button per robot (updates status, location, task, animates movement, logs events), Quick Demo Mode button (auto-creates 3 tasks, triggers bidding, assigns, simulates all movements, completes all tasks, shows multi-robot coordination).
*   **Robot Initial Placement:** All robots to be placed at ENTRANCE upon start/refresh.
*   **Destination Dropdown Fix:**  form dropdown to show exact 6 waypoint names with icons (üè•, üíä, üöë, üõèÔ∏è, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üì¶) in specific order, consistent across the app.
*   **Enhanced Robot Movement Visualization:** 3-second smooth transition, glowing path segment, pulsing glow, robot icon rotation, distance remaining, subtle arrival sound.
*   **Robot Count Adjustment:** Exactly 3 robots in the system.
*   **Final Polish & Integration Features:** About Page (project overview, team cards with roles, tech stack, hackathon info, GitHub/demo links, contact emails), MQTT Integration Documentation Page (topics, code examples, connection instructions), API Endpoint Documentation (auto-generated, curl examples, request/response formats), UI Polish (hover effects, consistent spacing, loading skeletons, error handling, empty state illustrations), Dark/Light Mode Switch.
*   **ENTRANCE Waypoint Modification (Current):** Transform ENTRANCE to a larger rounded rectangle parking station, position 3 robots horizontally within, add small labels R1, R2, R3, subtle dashed border.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of enhancing the ENTRANCE waypoint on the hospital map () to serve as a proper robot docking/parking station.

Specifically, the work involves:
1.  **Modifying the ENTRANCE Waypoint's Shape and Size:** Changing it from a circle to a larger rounded rectangle (150px wide x 80px tall) to visually represent a parking zone. This was addressed in .
2.  **Positioning Robots Horizontally:** Adjusting the logic to position robots (R1, R2, R3) horizontally in a row inside this new parking zone when they are docked at ENTRANCE. This includes ensuring proper spacing and relative positions (left, center, right). This was addressed in .
3.  **Adding Robot Labels:** Displaying small labels like R1, R2, R3 or robot names below each robot icon when they are parked. This is the last action mentioned: Now let me update the robot rendering to show labels for parked robots:.

The UI is expected to reflect this new ENTRANCE design with robots neatly arranged within it, alongside any optional parking spot markers and a subtle dashed border.
